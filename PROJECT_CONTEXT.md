## Architecture Notes

### Class/Assignment System (Jan 2026)
- Classes stored in global `classes` collection (searchable by code)
- Assignments stored in global `assignments` collection with embedded quiz data
- Submissions stored in global `submissions` collection
- When student joins class → fetches assignments from Firestore
- When student logs in → syncs assignments for all joined classes
- When teacher assigns quiz → saves to Firestore with questions embedded
- When student completes quiz → submission saved to Firestore
- When teacher logs in → fetches all submissions for their assignments

### Organization System
- Organizations have admin users who can invite others
- Members join via invite codes or email domain auto-join
- Organization admins manage members and settings
- Plans (School/University) are organization-level with per-teacher limits
